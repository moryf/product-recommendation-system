Customer Analysis and Product Recommendation System

## Description

This project is a Flask-based web application that provides various endpoints for customer analysis and product recommendations. It includes functionalities to analyze customer spending, identify best-selling products and categories, cluster customers based on their spending habits, and recommend products to customers based on their purchase history.

## Features

- **Average Spending per Customer**: Provides the average spending per customer.
- **Best Selling Products**: Lists the best-selling products.
- **Best Selling Categories**: Lists the best-selling categories.
- **Cluster Statistics**: Provides statistics for different customer clusters.
- **Product Recommendations**: Recommends products to customers based on their purchase history.

## Endpoints

- `GET /avg-customer`: Returns the average spending per customer.
- `GET /best-selling-products`: Returns the best-selling products.
- `GET /best-selling-categories`: Returns the best-selling categories.
- `GET /cluster_stats`: Returns cluster statistics.
- `GET /recommend-products/<customer_id>`: Recommends products for a given customer.
